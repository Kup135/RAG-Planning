    "\n",
    "From the Anthropic CookBook:\\\n",
    "\"Claude excels at a wide range of tasks, but it may struggle with queries specific to your unique business context. This is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becomes invaluable. RAG enables Claude to leverage your internal knowledge bases or customer support documents, significantly enhancing its ability to answer domain-specific questions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, relying on the Anthropic CookBook examples we are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Setting up a basic RAG system using an in-memory vector database and embeddings from [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Building a robust evaluation suite, measuring the retrieval pipeine & end to end performance independently.\n",
